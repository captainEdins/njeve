## Key Features

To improve the user experience and reduce data usage, the app implements the following features:

 - **Offline data caching:** Weather data is cached for 5 hours after it's retrieved, 
allowing users to interact with the app even without an internet connection. 
This saves users data by displaying the most recent data available.
 - **Refresh option:** Users can manually refresh the data by clicking the arrow next 
to their address, ensuring they have the latest information whenever they need it.

### Benefits:

 - **Reduced data consumption:** By caching data, users can avoid unnecessary data downloads,
especially beneficial for those with limited data plans.
 - **Improved user experience:** Offline data access allows users to view weather information
even when offline.
 - **Cost savings:** Reduced API calls lead to lower subscription costs for the app.
